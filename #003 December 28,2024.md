- **Topics Covered**:
  - Learned about the transition of the hover scale effect on images.

- **Code Challenges**:
  - Worked on a dynamic website for a side project: [WatchWrist E-Commerce](https://github.com/BanSimplified567/WatchWrist-E-Commerce).

- **Reflections**:
  - I was always confused about why the image kept scaling, so I tried to fix it with the help of ChatGPT. The solution was to set the container of the image to `relative` and apply `overflow: hidden`.
