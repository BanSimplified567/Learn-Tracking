- **Topics Covered**

- Practicing a potential capstone system for our school.

- **Code Challenges**:

- Downloaded an existing Barangay Information System project from the internet.
- The system stores residents' information, barangay officials' details, and staff roles like zone leaders.
- It also includes a blotter feature for recording incidents etc...

- **Reflections**:

- Successfully ran the system after making several adjustments. Planning to build my own system from scratch, as it’s more engaging and a great learning experience. For now, I’ll continue exploring and understanding this system before starting my own project.
