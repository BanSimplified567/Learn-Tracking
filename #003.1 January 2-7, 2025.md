## TIPS AND TRICKS

# 17 Tips from a Senior React Developer

## Tags

# react #webdev #javascript #career

I've been writing React code as an engineer at Palantir for the past 5+ years.

These are the 17 tips I wish someone had shared with me when I was starting.

Ready? Let's dive in! üí™

üìö Download my FREE 101 React Tips And Tricks Book for a head start.

---

## 1. Learn JavaScript before React

When I first started, I jumped from writing functions and basic DOM manipulation to learning React.

As you can guess, it didn't go well ü§Ø.

This is a common mistake for junior developers: trying to learn React without a solid understanding of JavaScript.

It's a recipe for confusion:

- You won't know what is React-specific and what is just JavaScript.
- Debugging becomes a nightmare.

### What to do instead?

Learn enough JavaScript to get comfortable (check out JavaScript to Know for React). Then, dive into React.

---

## 2. Read the React docs

You don't need money üí∞, a coach, or a fancy course to learn React.

Head to the official React website and:

- Follow the Quick Start guide.
- Read the learning chapters (even if they don't make sense initially, they'll click later).

---

## 3. Start building projects early

Watching tutorials won't make you a React developer.

Spending $100, $200, or even $700 on courses won't either.

### What will? Building projects

It's the best way to:

- Learn by making mistakes.
- Discover gaps in your knowledge.
- Pick up new patterns and tips.

### Stuck for ideas? Try these resources üëá

- **Frontend Mentor:** Projects for all skill levels.
- **Frontend Practice:** Recreate real websites.
- **Frontend Projects:** Varied project ideas.
- **JavaScript Mastery:** A YouTube channel with project-based tutorials.

## 4. Use trusted libraries

Not all packages are safe.

For example, in 2021, a popular NPM package, `ua-parser-js`, was hacked, spreading malware üìõ.

### To minimize risks

- Use libraries from trusted authors.
- Check for good download volumes and regular updates.

---

## 5. Solve problems with Vanilla JS when possible

Previously, you needed libraries like lodash for tasks like cloning, iteration, etc.

But modern JavaScript has improved a lot.

Now, you can achieve a lot with native methods.

### Why avoid extra libraries?

Every library you add:

- Increases your app's dependencies, making it more vulnerable to security issues.
- Potentially adds to your bundle size, slowing down load times.
- Increases your app‚Äôs build/compilation time.
- Creates maintenance overhead to keep dependencies updated.

Before reaching for a library, check if Vanilla JS can do the job. It often can üòâ.

---

## 6. Optimize bundle size and lazy load as much as possible

It starts slow.

You add one package here.

Then another there.

And then another.

Before you know it:

- Users complain the app takes too long to load.
- Developers complain the build process is painfully slow.

### How to fix it?

- Lazy-load as much as possible.
- Set up checks to track bundle size increases (Pull Request actions work well for this).
- Use [bundlephobia](https://bundlephobia.com/) to check package size before adding it to your project.

---

## 7. Colocate related logic

Grouping files by type (e.g., components, utils, i18n) might seem like a good idea, but it's not.

### Why?

- It's harder to follow a component's logic when files are scattered.
- You risk cleaning a component but forgetting related files.

Instead, keep all a component's logic and assets together in one folder.

---

## 8. Keep components simple

Avoid "God" components‚Äîthose that try to do everything.

### They're problematic ‚ùå because

- They're harder to read and understand.
- They often lead to version control conflicts.
- Modifying them can unintentionally impact the entire app.

### What to do instead?

Think about how you'd structure your code if you were working with a teammate.

Keep your components focused on one task to minimize conflicts.

---

## 9. Solve diverse problems

The more problems you solve with React, the better you get üöÄ.

Every challenge you tackle teaches you something valuable:

- You uncover new patterns and anti-patterns.
- You add more tools to your developer toolbox.
- You gain confidence in your skills.

### Key takeaway

Don't just practice‚Äî**vary your practice**.

---

## 10. Learn good programming patterns

As a React dev, you should also focus on foundational programming skills:

- **Data Structures & Algorithms** (e.g., sets, maps, recursion).
- **Principles** like those in *The Pragmatic Programmer*.

---

## 11. Read a ton of React code

Building projects isn't the only way to learn‚Äîreading code is just as valuable üí™.

### It helps you

- Pick up new tips and tricks.
- Compare approaches to solving problems.

### Where to start?

- Open-source projects on GitHub.
- Your teammates' code at work.

---

## 12. Use TypeScript ASAP

There's a before and an after TypeScript üòÖ.

### Before

- You spend extra time double-checking props.
- Debugging takes hours due to incorrect values.

### After

- You focus on structuring components and defining types.
- You catch silly mistakes before they reach production.

TypeScript isn't just a tool‚Äîit's a game changer.
